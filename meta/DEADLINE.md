## Part 1: App Description

> Please provide a firendly description of your app, including the app
> category that you chose, and the primary functions available to users
> of the app.

The app category I chose is External API Tool. My application is a library search app where a user can search either
a name of a book or author and can see the related books. Once the user enters a name of a book or author and
clicks the search button, the screen populates with 15 related book covers. By default the first book cover is selected.
However, the user can click on other book covers to get more information about the book. If what the user enters is not valid,
an error will pop up saying to try another book/author. If a book's cover image is not supplied in the API, "Image Unavailable"
will populate on the screen in place of the cover image. This information is coming from the OpenLibrary API. On the bottom left
side of the screen the user can get information such as the title of the book, the suggested title, and the ISBN number of the book.
If any of these informations can not be supplied by the API, null will be shown on the screen. On the bottom right side of the screen,
the user can get information about resale prices of the book. This information is coming from the BooksRun API. It will show prices for
how much you can sell the book to BooksRun.com if the book quality is average, good, or new. If the prices are $0 it means that BooksRun.com
is not buying this book. It also shows the status of getting the information.

## Part 2: New

I learned a lot about how to use APIs as well as using Gson and Json. I learned how I could get images as well
as string data from an API and how to convert that information so that it can be displayed in a proper manner.
I also learned more about Javafx and how I can create useful components for an application.

## Part 3: Retrospect

I would try to learn how I could add more functionality to my project as well as how I could
improve the look of the application. I would try to make the screen have more colors, use different
font types, etc. to make the app look more professional and appealing.
